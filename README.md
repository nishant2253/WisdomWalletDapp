- **Tech Stack:**


    **Next.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS:** "We use Next.js, a React-based framework, along with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. This ensures a smooth and engaging experience for all users on our platform."

    **Hardhat:** "For smart contract development and testing, we rely on Hardhat. It enables us to build, deploy, and interact with secure and efficient smart contracts on the blockchain."

    **Pinata:** "To store and manage decentralized file storage, we utilize Pinata. It plays a crucial role in handling the distributed storage of educational materials on the blockchain, ensuring accessibility and durability."

    **React:** "Our frontend is powered by React, providing a user-friendly and interactive interface for seamless navigation and resource sharing."

    **Metamask Wallet:** "To enhance user security and facilitate Web3 transactions, WisdomWallet integrates with the widely-used Metamask wallet. This ensures a secure and convenient way for users to interact with the blockchain."

    **Polygon Blockchain:** "For scalability and cost-effectiveness, WisdomWallet is built on the Polygon blockchain. This allows us to offer fast and low-cost transactions, making the platform accessible to users across different economic backgrounds."

    **Solidity:** "The smart contracts powering WisdomWallet are developed in Solidity, a language specifically designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It ensures the security and efficiency of our decentralized processes."

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
