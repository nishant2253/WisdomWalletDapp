## Key Features

- **Blockchain Transparency:** Every transaction is transparent and immutable, fostering trust and accountability.

- **Community-Driven:** Decentralization empowers the community, allowing users to shape the platform collectively.

- **Sustainability:** WisdomWallet promotes environmental sustainability by reusing educational materials, reducing deforestation, and encouraging afforestation.

- **Web3 Adoption:** Explore the Web3 space, with Matic coin rewards incentivizing users to engage in Web3 transactions.

- **Scalability:** Designed for developing nations, addressing challenges like illiteracy, corruption, and changing book editions.

## Getting Started

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/WisdomWallet.git
   ```

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
